After 6 years of working in finance in New York City and being on the receiving end of data and software I decided to take the plunge and make a career change into software development. My objective is to build intuitive and efficient software that helps the user gain insight from large datasets.

I took two bootcamps: FinTech at Columbia University and Software Development at Coding Dojo. Together they provided me with over 1,000 hours of hands-on learning. Since finishing the bootcamp at Coding Dojo I have been working on my own software. 

Languages: CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Python, Solidity, SQL. 
Libraries and Frameworks: Express, Flask, Node.js, pandas, React, scikit-learn, Socket.io, TensorFlow. 
Software: Bloomberg, Excel, GitHub, Haver, MySQL, Remix, STATA.

If you are aware of interesting opportunities in the Southern California area or if you just want to share resources donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Thank you!!

Authorized to work in the U.S. without restriction.
