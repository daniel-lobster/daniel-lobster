## My Favorite Projects

+ **[EthereumBonds](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/EthereumBonds)** is a decentralized application (dapp) built on React that by deploying a solidity contract allows borrowers to issue a zero-cupon bond in the Ethereum blockchain. Investors buy the bonds and they get paid back principal and interest in equal monthly installments. I made a 19-minute **[video](https://youtu.be/82erXHt1dUE?si=rz0xQ9DXnzDbUf-i)** showing the main features of the software.

+ **[Zuckerberg & Phelps](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/api_call_coingecko)** is a website that provides information on blockchain technology and crypto mining. I built the graphic user interface plus added an API call to show the price of crypto currencies. I made a 4-minute **[video](https://youtu.be/82erXHt1dUE?si=rz0xQ9DXnzDbUf-i)** showing how the API call works plus the site is **[live](http://zuckerbergphelps.com/)** for you to explore. 

+ **[Tourist Prophet](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/tourist_prophet)** is a Python application that forecasts tourist inflows to a country. The user selects the country, how far in the future they want the forecast and can include an optional dummy variable to isolate the effect of the pandemic. The application will produce four graphs and will save a file called 'forecast.csv' with all the data produced by the simulation. 

+ **[Crypto Montecarlo](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/crypto_monte_carlo_simulation)** is a Python application that allows the user to run a Montecarlo simulation of the future performance of a crypto currency. The app gets the data from Yahoo Finance API and allows the user to select the initial investment amount, number of simulations and number of days in the future.
