I help companies generate value out of data. This includes the design and implementation of business intelligence tools and the automation of functions. I am always learning the latest technologies so I can give my clients the comparative advantage they need. While Python is my main tool, I also know other languages that help me query databases and create dashboards. Part-time I train the next generation of data scientists through the exhaustive Columbia University's Data Analytics Boot Camp. 

**Languages:** HTML, JavaScript, Python, SQL. <br>
**Libraries and Frameworks:** Django, Flask, HuggingFace, Matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow.<br>
**Software:** AWS, GitHub, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Tableau.<br>

If you are aware of interesting opportunities or if you just want to share resources donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Thank you!!

## My Favorite Projects

+ **[Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/stock_montecarlo)** is a React app that allows the user the predict the price of a stock listed in the NYSE or Nasdaq. Visit the **[website](http://montecarlo-simulation-finnhub.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)** to see the app working and watch the 9-minute **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiC_8Lq3u8)** video. 

+ **[EthereumBonds](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/EthereumBonds)** is a decentralized application (dapp) built on React that by deploying a solidity contract allows borrowers to issue a zero-cupon bond in the Ethereum blockchain. Investors buy the bonds and they get paid back principal and interest in equal monthly installments. I made a 19-minute **[video](https://youtu.be/82erXHt1dUE?si=rz0xQ9DXnzDbUf-i)** showing the main features of the software.

+ **[Zuckerberg & Phelps](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/api_call_coingecko)** is a website that provides information on blockchain technology and crypto mining. I built the graphic user interface plus added an API call to show the price of crypto currencies. I made a 4-minute **[video](https://youtu.be/82erXHt1dUE?si=rz0xQ9DXnzDbUf-i)** showing how the API call works plus the site is **[live](http://zuckerbergphelps.com/)** for you to explore. 

+ **[Tourist Prophet](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/tourist_prophet)** is a Python application that forecasts tourist inflows to a country. The user selects the country, how far in the future they want the forecast and can include an optional dummy variable to isolate the effect of the pandemic. The application will produce four graphs and will save a file called 'forecast.csv' with all the data produced by the simulation.
