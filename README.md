## My Favorite Projects

+ **[EthereumBonds](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/EthereumBonds)** is a decentralized application (dapp) built on React that by deploying a solidity contract allows borrowers to issue a zero-cupon bond in the Ethereum blockchain. Investors buy the bonds and they get paid back principal and interest in equal monthly installments. I made a 19-minute **[video](https://youtu.be/82erXHt1dUE?si=rz0xQ9DXnzDbUf-i)** showing the main features of the software.

+ **[Zuckerberg & Phelps](https://github.com/daniel-lobster/api_call_coingecko)** is a website that gives information on blockchain technology and crypto mining. I built the graphic user interface plus added an API call to show the price of crypto currencies. I made a 4-minute **[video](https://youtu.be/82erXHt1dUE?si=rz0xQ9DXnzDbUf-i)** showing how the API call works plus the site is **[live](http://crypto.miner.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/coins)**.
