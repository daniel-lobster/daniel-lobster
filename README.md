After 6 years of working in finance in New York City and being on the receiving end of data and software I decided to take the plunge and make a career change into software development. My objective is to build intuitive and efficient software that helps the user gain insight from large datasets.

I took two bootcamps: FinTech at Columbia University and Software Development at Coding Dojo. Together they provided me with over 1,000 hours of hands-on learning. Since finishing the bootcamp at Coding Dojo I have been working on my own software. I am proficient in the following languages: Python, Java, JavaScript and Solidity. Libraries and frameworks: React, Node.js, Express, Flask, Socket.io, Hardhat, Ethers and Pandas. Software: Github, Ganache, Remix, MySQL, Bloomberg, STATA, Excel, Haver.

If you are aware of interesting opportunities in the Southern California area or if you just want to share resources donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Thank you!!

Authorized to work in the U.S. without restriction.
